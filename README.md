# LearningWebApp
A serverless web application created with React and hosted on Firebase. It supports user authentication with email/password or Google accounts. 
Live App: https://study-tool-b4548.web.app

This app has two main features:
1. The ability to create, edit, and study private, virtual flashcard sets.
2. An interval timer/pacer that allows the user to specify work and rest intervals. This can be used as a Pomodoro timer.

## Flashcards
Flashcard sets are linked to a user id, so a user can access their study sets from their laptop, phone, or tablet.

Flashcard creation can be done manually using my user friendly interface for creating and modifying card decks, or flashcard creation can be done via bulk upload in JSON format. 

### Get started fast with mass upload

### View and modify the cards you created

## Interval Timer
Use the interval timer to manage your time while studying or doing work. The interval timer uses a browser's localStorage to save the most recently used intervals. It also allows a timer to maintain its state if a user accidentally refreshes or closes the page.

When a timer expires, a browser notification will show in addition to the timer display flashing and a chime sound playing.

### View the countdown in the browser tab

## Planned Features

- üß† Memory Game mode ‚Äî interactive game to reinforce flashcards
- üìù Test mode ‚Äî generate quizzes from deck content
- üîÄ Shuffle mode ‚Äî study cards in random order
- Integrated AI Powered Deck Creation - Rather than requiring a user to query ChatGPT themself, I'd like to allow them to just input a topic and handle the query and deck creation from inside the app.
